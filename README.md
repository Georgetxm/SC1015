# SC1015 Mini-Project - Estimating Time of Food Delivery

## About 
This is the mini project for SC1015 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI). We performed analysis on the estimated time for food delivery [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset?select=train.csv) from Kaggle.

### Problem Motivation
With online orders increasing since the pandemic, customers want to know when their orders will arrive, and they expect those estimates to be as precise as possible. Inaccurate delivery time estimates can cause customer dissatisfaction, leading to negative ratings and lost business for the delivery platform.

### Problem Definition
- Can we predict the estimated time of delivery based on the delivery rider's attributes?
- Are we able to identify any biases in ratings without factoring in performance metrics like delivery timings?
