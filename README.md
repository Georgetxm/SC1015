# SC1015 Mini-Project - Estimating Time of Food Delivery

## About 
This is the mini project for SC1015 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI). We performed analysis on the estimated time for food delivery [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset?select=train.csv) from Kaggle.

### Problem Definition
- Can we predict the estimated time of delivery based on the delivery rider's attributes?
- Are we able to identify any biases in ratings based strictly on the attributes of the delivery rider, omitting delivery timings?
